# Simple Map
A beautifully simple Google Map field type for Craft CMS. Full localization support, compatible with Matrix, supports 
searching by location and sorting by distance.

## Installation
Copy the `simplemap` folder into `craft/plugins`.

## Usage
Create the field as you would any other.  
The field type will return an array containing `lat`, `lng`, `zoom`, `address`, and `parts`. This means you can use `{{ myMapField.lat }}`.

**`parts`**

This contains the locations address, broken down into its constituent parts. All values are optional so you'll need to have checks on any you use to make sure they exist.  
A list of the available values can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro#Types).  
To access the short version of any part, append `_short` to the end of its name. E.g. `{{ myMapField.country_short }}`.

**Searching and Sorting**

You can search for elements using the location specified in your map field. When searching by your map field you also have the option to sort the results by distance.

```twig
{% set entries = craft.entries.myMapField({
    location: 'Maidstone, Kent, UK',
    radius: 100,
    unit: 'mi'
}).order('distance') %}
```

- `location`: Can either be an address string (requires a Google Maps Geocoding API key) or a Lat Lng Array (`{ 'lat': 51.27219908, 'lng': 0.51545620 }` or `craft.simpleMap.latLng(51.27219908, 0.51545620)`).
- `radius`: The radius around the location to search. Defaults to `50`.
- `unit`: The unit of measurement for the search. Can be either `km` (kilometers) or `mi` (miles). Defaults to `km`.

**API Keys**

You can access your browser API key in templates using `craft.simpleMap.apiKey`.
