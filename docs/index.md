# Maps

A beautifully simple, yet deceptively powerful, Map field that works out of the 
box with no setup or API tokens needed! 

Configure the map field to only show the features you want; hide the address, 
show latitude / longitude, or hide the map entirely. Choose from 4 geocoding 
services, 3 geolocation services, and 24 map tilesets!

Maps offers full mutli-site support, compatibility with Matrix, 
[SuperTable](https://verbb.io/craft-plugins/super-table/features), and 
[CraftQL](https://plugins.craftcms.com/craftql), and the ability to search by 
location and sort by distance.
